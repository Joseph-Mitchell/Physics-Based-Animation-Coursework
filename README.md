# Physics Based Animation Coursework

This repository contains the practical work from my Physics Based Animation module. The module involved learning the maths behind real word physical interactions and how to use them to recreate these interactions with software.

This repository is forked from the original practical work repository, with my implimentations of the required solutions. Below is the original instructions to build the project using CMake.

**Software Requirements:**

* Latest stable CMake (GUI version helps)
* Visual Studio Community

**Project Build Instructions:**

* Open CMake
* Set Source Folder to the "code" directory
* Set Build Folder to a directory called "build", under "code" (e.g. /your/path/code/build)
* Run Configure, and just select default compilers, Visual Studio x64 should be the one that appears
* Run Generate
* Now, in the Build folder, you should see the solution file set09119.sln
